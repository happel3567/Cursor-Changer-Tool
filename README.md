# Cursor Customizer Tool for Windows

Simply download the exe file named "Cursor Customizer" to use the tool. 

This tool lets you upload a PNG file and it will convert it to a cursor file, this cursor file will be automatically named "cursor.cur" and placed in your C drive. Simply press "Use This Image" which will open the Windows Mouse Properties application where you can set the image as your new cursor

### Warning
Because the tool makes and names a file on your computer it will be flagged by windows defender as malicious but you can look through the code to see that it does nothing but make the file named "cursor.cur"
